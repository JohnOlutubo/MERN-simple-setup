# MERN Stack Development Environment Setup

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack template to help you get started with web development.

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment, it is recommended to use a workspace, IDE, version control software, and browser options suitable for web development. You can select the tools you prefer.

Once you have your workspace ready, you can set up the MERN stack technologies by installing MongoDB, Node, and Yarn, and then adding the remaining required libraries using Yarn.

To compile and bundle your code during development, Webpack and Babel have been configured. React Hot Loader has also been included for frontend development and Nodemon for backend development to make the development flow more efficient.

To run the application during development, simply run one command to compile both the client and server code.

I hope this template helps you set up your MERN development environment quickly and efficiently.
